TMC provides APIs in the form of Tango device commands for controlling the telescope as follows:

* `TelescopeOn <https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-tmc-centralnode/en/latest/api/ska_tmc_centralnode.commands.html#ska-tmc-centralnode-commands-telescope-on-command-module>`_
* `TelescopeOff <https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-tmc-centralnode/en/latest/api/ska_tmc_centralnode.commands.html#ska-tmc-centralnode-commands-telescope-off-command-module>`_
* `Standby <https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-tmc-centralnode/en/latest/api/ska_tmc_centralnode.commands.html#ska-tmc-centralnode-commands-telescope-standby-command-module>`_


Monitoring of the telescope level activities can be done by reading/subscribing to 
the following Tango attributes exposed by Tango attributes exposed by 
.. :ref:`Central Node <components_cn>`:

* telescopeState
* telescopeHealthState
* telescopeAvailability
* transformedInternalModel

..  Additionally, monitoring of individual TMC component can be done by reading/subscribing 
    to the attributes exposed by various TMC components. Please refer to 
    #:ref:`Knowledge Base <knowledge_base>` > :ref:`Components <components>`
