    """A sequence of `TelescopeAction`s, executed in order.

    This action is used to group a sequence of actions together, so that the
    can be executed as a single action. The sub-actions are executed in
    the order they are provided and the synchronization is done after
    each sub action (step). By default, this action does not have further
    termination conditions.

    By default, each step keeps the default wait termination condition
    timeout. Calling the ``set_termination_condition_timeout(timeout)``
    method you will apply the change to each of the steps.

    By default, the termination condition policy is set to wait for the
    termination condition of each of the steps. Calling
    ``set_termination_condition_policy(False)`` you will make the last
    step to not wait for the termination condition (but all the others
    will still keep their previous policy).
    Calling ``set_termination_condition_policy(True)`` you will
    make all the steps to wait for the termination condition. If you need,
    you can set the termination condition policy for each step by calling
    the method on each of them (you can access them through :py:attr:`steps`).
