    This class is a tool to generate configurations for the various

    - TMC
    - CSP
    - SDP
    - the dishes

    It is also used to read the configuration that specifies which components
    are emulated and which are production ones.

    Since some configurations are static, some are read from the environment
    and some depend on the emulation configuration, to keep things
    consistent (without having global variables) every time an instance of
    this class is created, the emulation configuration is read from the
    environment and then the other configurations are generated accordingly.
