Scenario Outline: Error Propagation Reported by TMC Mid AssignResources/ReleaseAllResources/Configure/End/EndScan/Scan Commands for Defective Subarray
		Given the telescope is is ON state
		And the TMC subarray is in the <initialObsState> observation state
		When <command> is invoked on a defectiveSubsystem <defectiveSubsystem>
		Then the command failure is reported by subarray with error message
		Then the TMC SubarrayNode transitions to FAULT obsState
		Examples:
		            |initialObsState  | command          | defectiveSubsystem   |
