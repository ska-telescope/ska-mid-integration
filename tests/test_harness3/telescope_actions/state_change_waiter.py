class StateChangeWaiter:
    """A tool to wait for a set of state changes from multiple Tango devices.

    This class is used to wait for a set of state changes to occur
    on multiple Tango devices. You use this class by creating an
    instance of it, progressively adding state changes to wait for,
    and then calling the `wait_all` method to wait for all the state
    changes to occur (or for a timeout to occur). If all the state
    changes occur before the timeout, the execution continues, else
    it will raise an exception.

    An instance of this class can be shared among multiple classes, so
    you can separate the responsibility of knowing what conditions
    to wait for each group of devices (e.g., a TMC class may know what
    to wait for the TMC devices, and a CSP class may know what to wait
    for the CSP devices, etc.) and also move the `wait_all` call in a
    common orchestrator class (that doesn't need to know the details
    of what to wait for).

    Calling the method `reset` you will clear the list of expected
    state changes, so you can reuse the same instance for multiple
    actions.

    TODO: explain the abstract state and protocol of this class:
    it has a tracer and incrementally a list of events
    to wait for. The tracer subscribes to such events.
