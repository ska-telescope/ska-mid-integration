Scenario Outline: Error Propagation Reported by TMC Mid End/EndScan/Scan Commands for Defective Subarray
		Given the telescope is is ON state
		And the TMC subarray is in the <initialObsState> observation state
		When <command> is invoked on a <defectiveSubsystem> Subarray
		Then the command failure is reported by subarray with appropriate error message
		Then the TMC SubarrayNode remains in <stuck> obsState
		Examples:
		            |initialObsState  | command | defectiveSubsystem  |stuck|
		            |READY            | END     | CSP                  | READY |
		            |READY            | END     | DISH                 | READY |
		            |SCANNING         | ENDSCAN | CSP                  | SCANNING |
		            |SCANNING         | ENDSCAN | DISH                 | SCANNING |
		            |READY            | SCAN    | CSP                  | SCANNING |
		            |READY            | SCAN    | DISH                 | SCANNING |
		            |READY            | END     | SDP                  | READY|
		            |SCANNING         | ENDSCAN | SDP                  | SCANNING|
		            |READY            | SCAN    | SDP                  | SCANNING|
