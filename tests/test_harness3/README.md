# Architecture of the test harness

This test harness is code that glues integration test scripts to the SUT. It is designed to provide a consistent interface for all tests, to be **powerful** (allowing for complex tests), to be **flexible** (extensible to meet the needs of different SUTs and different tests), to be **easy to use** (so that tests can be written quickly),  to be **easy to maintain** (so that tests can be updated quickly) and **reliable** (so that tests can be trusted).

For the  time being the test harness is designed to work with Tango Devices, and specifically to support tests for integration of TMC with CSP in MID, but it can be extended to work with other types of components.

This test harness comprises:

* **facades**, aimed at providing a consistent interface to the SUT so that test scripts are insulated from internal details 
* **actions**, which are the building blocks of tests and each include a relatively complex action that can be performed on the SUT (like sending a command to a device)
* **wrappers**, which wrap components of the SUT
* **argument factories**, which are used to create arguments for actions (eg. the JSON string to use for a CONFIGURE command) TODO: verify this
* **configurators**, which are used to gather configuration data or flags from files or options given to pytest used to setup the proper instances
* **emulators**, which are real tango devices whose behaviour is programmed to simulate in a very simple way the behaviour of real devices. The are needed to ensure that SUT is embedded in the environment that it expects.


# RULES

## RULE 1: Tests are agnostic to the test environment

Test scripts should know as little as possible about the test environments so that the same test, with different configurations, can be run in different environments (like the cloud, an ITF, a PSI). 

## RULE 2: Tests are agnostic to the SUT ecosystem

Integration tests make use of emulators and simulators. In many cases test scripts can be implemented in such a way that they do not know which devices are real and which are emulated. In this way, the same test script can be run with different configurations of real and emulated devices.

Of course, somewhere one needs to say that a device is emulated and what should its behaviour be. This is done in the configuration files/flags and, because emulated devices are de facto Tango Devices, they should be defined, implemented and deployed prior to the execution of the test script (and hence prior to the execution of the test harness).

In some cases it may be necessary for the test script to make assertions on emulators (i.e. to use them as @SPY [Spy objects as test doubles - Meszaros](http://xunitpatterns.com/Test%20Spy.html)). In these cases such a test makes the assumption that the device is emulated. By carefully writing assertions though, and through the use of [tracer objects](https://developer.skao.int/projects/ska-tango-testing/en/latest/guide/integration/index.html#tracer-objects), it is possible to write tests that can be run with real devices and emulators without knowing it. See below for examples.

# Design decisions

## Why use facades?
As mentioned above we want to insulate test scripts from the details of the SUT. 

For example, a test that verifies that the SCAN command works as expected, will use a facade of the TMC Central Node and a facade of the TMC Subarray Node. These facade will provide properties of the two components and methods to interact with them. The test script will not know that the TMC Central Node is a Tango Device and that the TMC Subarray Node is a Tango Device. It will not know that the TMC Central Node has a property called `state` and that the TMC Subarray Node has a method called `scan`. It will only know that there is a facade called `TMC` that has a property called `central_node` and a facade called `subarray_node` that has a method called `scan`. 

We opted for having more than just one facade, to avoid bloating a class with too many unrelated functionalities ([Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)).

Facade is a design pattern ([FACADE](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade)) that provides a simplified interface to a complex system. In this case the complex system is part of the SUT.


## Why use actions?

A test script has to interact with the SUT and send it operations to perform. These operations are complex and require multiple steps, possibly involving more than one component. In a distributed system like the telescope, the operations are often asynchronous and involve multiple devices, each evolving with its own timing.

Very frequently an operation is not just a single command, but a sequence of commands.  In these cases we often have to wait for something to happen on some part of the SUT before starting a subsequent step. 

Actions are building blocks that encapsulate the complexity of these operations. They are designed to be easy to use and to be powerful. They embed both the operation to be performed and their termination condition, that is checked within a timeout. For the time being termination conditions can only be expressed with a list of expected tango change events.

An action can eventually be "executed", by calling the `execute` method of the action. This method will perform the operation, wait for its termination and return a result. The details of how to execute an action (for example, what Tango Command to send to a device) are hidden from the test script.

The test scripts invokes a facade method called `scan()`, which instantiates an action called `SubarrayScan`, adds to it the necessary arguments and then calls its `execute` method. The `execute` method gathers the necessary device proxies, sends the `scan` command to the TMC Subarray Node and waits for the set of events listed in the action to occur.

Actions are based on the [COMMAND](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/command), [TEMPLATE] and [COMPOSITE](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite) design pattern.    

## Why using wrappers?

Wrappers embed the parts of the SUT that the test script needs to interact with. In the current test harness wrappers wrap Tango Device Proxies. 
Their responsibility is to hold the details about how to interact to such devices (i.e. names of commands, format of their input, attribute names and values, etc.).


## Why using argument factories?

TODO

## Why using configurators?

These are mechanisms that collect configuration data from files or runtime flags, represent them in objects, and support fixtures to setup the proper instances of the classes that represent the structure of the SUT and the facades.

There are a number of classes that represent the default configuration of the structure of the SUT. For example, the class `TMCConfiguration` contains the names of the devices that are part of the TMC. The class `CSPConfiguration` contains the names of the devices that are part of the CSP.

The class `ConfigurationFactory` is used to create instances of these classes.  

The class `TelescopeStructureFactory` is used to create instances of the facades and the structure of the SUT. It uses the `ConfigurationFactory` to create the instances of the classes that represent the structure of the SUT.



# How to extend this harness

At the moment (July 2024) this harness has no well defined extension points. So to adapt it to your needs the best way is to subclass key existing classes and override their methods or create your own classes.

Key classes are:

* Facade: create your own facade class.
* Action: create your own action class by subclassing `TelescopeAction` or `TelescopeActionSequence`.
* Wrapper: create your own wrapper class, by subclassing existing ones. You'll need also to subclass the top structure class which is `TelescopeWrapper`.
* TestHarnessConfigurationFactory: subclass it and override its methods to provide alternative configurations. 
* TelescopeStructureFactory: subclass it and override its methods to instantiate your own facades.
