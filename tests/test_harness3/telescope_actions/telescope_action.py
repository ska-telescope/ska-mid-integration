class TelescopeAction(abc.ABC):
    """A generic action executed over the telescope and its subsystems.

    An action is made by:

    - the action itself, which is the procedure that interacts
        with telescope subsystems (TMC, CSP, SDP, Dishes);
    - a termination condition, which is a set
        of expected events that should occur after the action is executed
        and which define a successful completion of the action.

    This class is a template for such actions.

    To create a new action, you create a subclass of ``TelescopeAction``
    and you implement the abstract methods
    :py:meth:`_action` and :py:meth:`termination_condition`.
    You define your business logic in the
    :py:meth:`_action` method and you define the termination condition
    in the :py:meth:`termination_condition` method, as a list of
    :py:class:`tests.test_harness3.telescope_actions.expected_events.ExpectedEvent`
    instances (or subclasses).

    To run an action, you call the method :py:meth:`execute`. The action
    is executed and the termination condition is waited for until a timeout.
    You can customize the timeout by calling the method
    :py:meth:`change_timeout` before calling the :py:meth:`execute` method.

    If your action needs some parameters, you can override the
    :py:meth:`__init__` method to accept them and store them as
    instance attributes.

    The same action can potentially be executed multiple times.

    This class is strongly inspired by the Command design pattern
    (https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/command), since it abstracts
    a potentially complex action into a class, incapsulating and hiding
    the execution details of the action itself, such as having available
    a telescope instance and waiting for the termination condition to occur.
    Since it leaves you some methods to implement (that will instead
    be called by this class itself), it is also inspired
    by the Template Method design pattern
    (https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/template-method).
